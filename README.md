# Day 6 ‚Äì Reeborg's World: Hurdles & Maze Escape üß†üêç

## Description
This project introduces the creation and usage of Python functions by solving visual programming challenges in **Reeborg's World**.
https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html

You solve two main problems:

- **Hurdle Race**: Help Reeborg jump over a series of hurdles using defined functions.
- **Maze Escape**: Navigate a maze using looped function logic and conditional movement.

The focus is on writing modular, readable, and reusable code using functions.

## Challenges Solved
- Hurdle Jump (various levels)
- Escape the Maze

## Example Function
```python
def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
```

## Skills Learned
- Defining and calling Python functions
- Reusing logic through functions
- Looping and conditional control flow
- Thinking algorithmically to solve visual tasks
